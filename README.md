# IOT-OBD
This is is the python code that was running on a raspberry pi that was connected by hotspot to a firebase database and via an obd2 connector to a vehicle. I used the python.obd library to harvest data from the car, did some processing and uploaded that data to firebase. This was for an IOT class project. This was a proof of concept of a fleet management system where we showed what data couldbe easily harvested from a car. Then one could view all the data in one place via an application. From the obd2 port we grabbed the fuel percentage, miles driven in a trip, error codes, and current speed of the vehicle. We used this data to calculate the mileage, how soon the car will run out of gas, and how soon it will need an oil change. Then all this data is stored in the database. A trip is started using a seperate iphone app, which triggers the pi to start collecting data. We also used the gps of the phone to record the end location of a trip so that the last known position of the car is stored in the database. This allowed us to show where the car was last parked.
